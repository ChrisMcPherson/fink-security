*Fink: to inform on to the authorities.*

Fink Security is a system of edge data collectors in the home coming together to assess potential threats. Traditional security systems require the system to be "armed" by the home owner to be active and have independent sensors that do not share information with each other. For example, if a home owner with a traditional system drops a glass with the system armed, the alarm will sound even though the other sensors are confident there is no threat.

Fink Security will support a wide array of data collectors, such as:

- Facial recognition 
- License plate recognition
- MAC/IP address recognition
- Door/Window open sensors
- Audio sensors

Using reinforcement learning techniques, Fink Security has been trained to learn what combinations of events ingested from the data collectors are indicative of an active threat.
